Winning submission for YouTube's APIs challenge for Google IO 2011 tickets.

[Official Challenge Description](https://sites.google.com/site/lastcallforio2011/youtube-apis)
> Video Meets the JavaScript API
> Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could create a video mash-up by chaining player invocations that work for both Flash and HTML5 videos ? Well, with the JavaScript API to the <iframe> embed we think you can.
> 
> Your task is to build a mash-up player using the <iframe> JavaScript API. You will be given a list of video IDs, and from-to timestamps. For example the following sequence (<xxasdadad, 65s, 95s>, <xxffwwe22, 20s, 35s>), which will trigger the mash-up player to play video with ID xxasdadad for 30 seconds, starting at second 65 and ending at second 95, then proceed to play video with ID xxffwwe22, starting at second 20 and ending at second 35.
> 
> Given the sequence, implement a player which will play the sections of the listed videos, starting at the \u2018from\u2019 timestamp, and ending at the \u2018to\u2019 timestamp for each video.
> 
> Try to make the transitions between videos as smooth as possible, and make it easy for users to embed your mash-up player in their own web applications.

Caveat emptor: This is the first JS that I've ever written and the first time I've used jQuery. Also, it was written within the 24-hour time limit.
